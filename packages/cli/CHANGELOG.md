# panam-cli

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 5cf7788: We have restructured the Panam project into a **workspace**
  to improve scalability and maintainability.
  This update introduces significant changes and new features.

  ### üîî Key Changes

  - **Separation into Core API and CLI:**

    Panam has been split into two distinct packages:

    - `panam`: The core API for handling commands
      and providing runtime-agnostic functionalities.

    - `panam-cli`: A user-friendly command-line interface
      built on top of the core API.

  - **Introduction of `panam-cli`:**

    A brand-new CLI package providing a consistent and streamlined interface
    for executing package manager commands.

  - **Documentation Updates:**

    The documentation has been updated to reflect the new workspace structure
    and explain the usage of both `panam` and `panam-cli`.
